    In Cilium with CNI chaining, **EndpointRoutes are not supported**. When Cilium operates in chaining mode, the primary CNI is responsible for all routing decisions and network topology management.

    Here's why and how it works:

    ## CNI Chaining Limitations

    When Cilium runs as a chained CNI (typically as a secondary CNI for policy enforcement), it operates with several constraints:

    - **No control over routing**: The primary CNI manages all routing tables and network paths
    - **No direct endpoint management**: Cilium can't create or modify routes to individual pod endpoints
    - **Limited network topology control**: The network structure is determined by the primary CNI

    ## EndpointRoutes Requirements

    EndpointRoutes require Cilium to have full control over:
    - Per-endpoint route installation
    - Direct routing between nodes
    - Network topology decisions
    - Route table management

    ## Typical Chaining Scenarios

    Common setups where EndpointRoutes won't work:

    ```yaml
    # Example: Cilium chained with AWS VPC CNI
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
      name: cilium-config
    data:
      cni-chaining-mode: "aws-cni"
      enable-endpoint-routes: "false"  # Must be disabled
    ```

    ## Alternative Approaches

    When using CNI chaining, you typically rely on:

    1. **Primary CNI routing** (e.g., AWS VPC CNI handles all routing)
    2. **Encapsulation modes** if supported by the chaining configuration
    3. **Standard cluster networking** provided by the primary CNI

    ## Full Cilium Deployment

    To use EndpointRoutes, you need Cilium as the primary/only CNI:

    ```yaml
    # This enables EndpointRoutes
    enable-endpoint-routes: "true"
    cni-chaining-mode: ""  # No chaining
    ```

    So in summary: **CNI chaining = no EndpointRoutes**. The primary CNI owns all routing decisions in chained setups.
