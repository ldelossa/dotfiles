desc="Commands for building and deploy a kernel on a remote machine

 These commands typically work by pushing a local kernel source repository to
 a remote development server, performing an action, and syncing the results
 back to the host.

 This is a typical development pattern so you can hack on a remote kernel and
 not on the machine you're developing from."
