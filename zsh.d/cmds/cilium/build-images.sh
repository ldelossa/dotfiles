help=("build-images", "Helper for building Cilium agent and operator images.

 Images are built with the quay.io/cilium/ prefix unless --account is
 specified, for example:
 quay.io/cilium/operator-generic and quay.io/cilium/cilium-dev.
 If --account is specified the resulting images will be tagged as
 '\$account/operator-generic' and '\$account/cilium-dev'

 Therefore, they can be directly pushed to Quay with the proper permissions for
 distribution.

 If the --debug flag is set a debug image is created. This image uses dlv as a
 Cilium process host and will wait for a remote debugger to connect to it. Once
 connected the Cilium application will run as normal.

 If the --push flag is set the successfully built images will be pushed to
 Quay.io. You must have permissions to do so prior to running the command.

 This script should be ran from the root a Cilium source code repository.
